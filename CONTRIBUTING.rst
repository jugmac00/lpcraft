Developing
==========

To run this project's tests, use `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

To update the `project's documentation
<https://lpcraft.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ you need to trigger a manual
build on the project's dashboard on https://readthedocs.org.

If you need to modify ``requirements.in``, run ``tox -e pip-compile``
afterwards to regenerate ``requirements.txt``.
